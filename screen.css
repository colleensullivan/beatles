/* -------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright guys, this should be fun. Follow the instructions inline.
Make all the changes with CSS only â€” the HTML shouldn't change at all.
This one is gonna be a little bit of a challenge!

nav {
    /* 1. Add one rule here that makes the nav stick to the top of the window as the page scrolls. */

nav li {
    /* Notice how the selector here has a space in it. This tells CSS to apply the following */
    /* rules ONLY to <li> elements that are INSIDE <nav> elements. This is called a nested tag. */

    /* 4. Add one rule here that puts all these elements on one line. */

    /* 5. Add another rule that puts some space between them. */

    /* 6. If you see bullets on your list items, add a rule to remove them. */

    /* 8. Make this div centered on the page. To do this, you need to define a width.*/
    /* Make the div a little wider than the 2x2 image of the Beatles. */

    /* 9. We'd also like the text itself to be centered. */

    border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;

.beatle {
    /* 10. Add a rule that makes this element the same width as the intro. */

    /* 11. And center it the same way. */

    margin-bottom: 40px;
}

/* 12. Write a selector that gets applied to JUST images that live withing divs of class "beatle". */
/* Reference the LI rule above for the syntax. */

/* 13. In the selector from #12, add ONE rule that does takes the Beatles images out of the flow so, you can position it. */
/* 14. Then add a rule to make each picture 200px wide. */

/* 15. In order for those images to be positioned relative to the block of text, you also need to add one rule to the _previous_ ruleset. */
/* 16. Then add a rule here to position the image to be align with the top of each .beatle div. */
/* 17. And with one last rule, put 40px of space between the right edge of the image and the left edge of the text. */
/*     (Hint: this requires using a negative value.) */

.source {
     /* 18. Finally, add a few rules to centered the source element and the text inside of it. */
     /* 19. And give it a light top border, too. */

    margin-top: 20px;
    padding-top: 20px;
